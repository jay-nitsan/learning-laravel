## **Project Overview**  

Develop a fully functional **blog website** using **PHP** and the **Laravel framework**, with **MySQL** as the database. The website should provide an intuitive platform for users to create, manage, and engage with blog posts. The system will have three types of users: **Admin, Registered Users, and Website Visitors**, each with specific roles and permissions.  

## **Technologies Stack**  

- **Backend:** PHP (Laravel Framework)  
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Authentication:** Laravel Auth, Laravel Sanctum (optional for API security)  

## **Core Functionalities**  

### **1. Blog Management**  
- **List & Display:** Show all blog posts in a paginated format.  
- **Detail View:** View the full content of a blog post, including author info, categories, and tags.  
- **Create & Publish:** Allow registered users to create and submit blogs.  
- **Update & Delete:** Enable users to update and delete their own blogs.  
- **Admin Approval:** Blogs require admin approval before publishing.  
- **Filters & Categories:** Implement filtering by **categories, tags, and date**.  
- **Search Functionality:** Enable searching for blog posts by keywords.  
- **Sorting by Ratings:** Blogs should be sorted based on user ratings.  

### **2. User Roles & Permissions**  

#### **Admin**  
- Approve, edit, and delete any blog post.  
- Manage users (block, delete, or promote to admin).  
- Publish their own blog posts without approval.  
- Access a dashboard with analytics (total blogs, users, top-rated blogs).  

#### **Registered User**  
- Register/Login to the website.  
- Post new blogs (pending approval by admin).  
- View, update, and delete their own blog posts.

- Reset password via email.  

#### **Website Visitor (Guest Users)**  
- View all approved blog posts.  
- Rate blog posts (session-based, without login).  
- Search for blogs using keywords or filters.  

## **3. User Authentication & Security**  

- Laravel's built-in authentication system for **registration, login, and logout**.  
- Password reset and email verification.  
- Rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.  
- CSRF protection for all forms.  
- Middleware-based role management.  

## **4. Additional Features**  

- **Responsive UI:** Mobile-friendly design using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.  
- **Session-based Blog Rating:** Unauthenticated users can rate blogs, but it's stored via session.  
- **SEO-friendly URLs & Meta Tags:** Generate slugs dynamically.  
- **Comment System:** Users can leave comments on blog posts (admin moderation required).  
- **API Endpoints (Optional):** Provide API access for mobile app integration.  
- **Cache Optimization:** Use Laravel Cache for performance improvements.  

## **Deployment & Maintenance**  

- Use **Laravel Migrations & Seeders** to set up database structure.  
- **Automated Testing** for core features using PHPUnit.  
- Deployment via **Laravel Forge, Docker, or shared hosting**.
